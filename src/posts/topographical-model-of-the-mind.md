The topographical model of the mind is a way of explaining how thoughts and feelings are organized based on how aware we are of them. It divides the mind into three parts: the conscious (what weâ€™re aware of), the preconscious (what we can bring to mind easily), and the unconscious (hidden thoughts and feelings that still affect us). This model helps explain why we sometimes act or feel things without fully understanding why.
