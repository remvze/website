## TL;DR:

The Categorical Imperative is a moral principle that says we should act only on rules we can will to be universal laws and always treat others as ends, not merely as means. It emphasizes duty over consequences and divides moral obligations into perfect and imperfect duties.

The Categorical Imperative is a principle in moral philosophy used to determine what is right and wrong through reason alone. It is an unconditional rule that applies to all rational beings, regardless of their goals or desires. It is grounded in the idea that all rational beings are capable of moral autonomy—that is, of giving moral laws to themselves through reason.

Unlike hypothetical imperatives, which depend on specific outcomes (e.g., "If you want X, do Y"), the Categorical Imperative commands actions that must be followed in all situations.

One formulation of this principle states that a person should act only according to a rule they would want everyone else to follow at all times. This test involves checking whether the action's guiding rule, or maxim, could become a universal law without causing contradiction or harm.

Maxims fail the test of universalization if they lead to a contradiction in conception (undermining the very possibility of the action) or a contradiction in will (conflicting with what a rational agent could consistently will).

Another formulation states that people must always treat others as ends in themselves, never merely as means to achieve personal aims, and that they should always respect others' dignity and autonomy.

This principle emphasizes moral consistency and duty over consequences, meaning an action is right or wrong regardless of its outcome. Actions have moral worth only when done from a sense of duty, rather than for personal gain or emotion.

The Categorical Imperative divides duties into two types: perfect duties, which must always be followed (such as not lying), and imperfect duties, which allow flexibility in how they are fulfilled (such as helping others).
