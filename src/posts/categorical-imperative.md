The Categorical Imperative is a big idea from moral philosophy that helps us figure out what’s the right thing to do. Think of it like a special rule that says: only do something if you’d be okay with everyone in the world doing the same thing. That’s called the universal law idea — asking, “What if this were a rule for everyone?”

It also says we should never treat people like objects or tools, which is called the humanity principle. That means we should respect others and not just use them to get what we want.

A categorical rule is one you must follow no matter what, not just when you feel like it or when it helps you. So if you follow this rule because it’s the right thing, and not just to get a reward or avoid trouble, that’s called acting from duty.

This idea matters because it helps us think beyond our own wants and think about what’s fair and respectful for everyone. It’s about doing what’s right, just because it’s right — not because of what you’ll get from it. That’s why the Categorical Imperative is used to test whether our choices are truly moral.
