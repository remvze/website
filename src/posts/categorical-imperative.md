The Categorical Imperative, a central concept in the ethical philosophy of Immanuel Kant, urges individuals to act according to principles they would want everyone else to follow universally.

One key formulation, the Formula of Universal Law, advises acting only by rules that could become universal laws without contradiction or undermining one's own rational will. This involves testing if the maxim behind an action would still be possible or desirable if everyone acted on it.

Another important formulation, the Formula of Humanity as End in Itself, emphasizes treating all people, including oneself, as having inherent worth and never merely as tools to achieve a goal.

This ethical framework is deontological, focusing on the inherent rightness or wrongness of actions based on moral rules, rather than their consequences. It posits a necessary and universally binding moral law derived from reason, guiding individuals to act out of duty and respect for the dignity of all rational beings.
