The Categorical Imperative is a moral principle stating that you should act according to rules that you could rationally want everyone else to follow universally. It also emphasizes treating every person as valuable in themselves, never merely using them to achieve your own goals. Essentially, it’s about acting based on duty and principles that are valid for all rational beings.
