The Categorical Imperative is a principle in moral philosophy that provides a test for determining whether an action is morally right. It states that one should act only according to rules that could be followed by everyone at all times. This principle is unconditional and applies to all people regardless of their goals or desires. It contrasts with hypothetical imperatives, which apply only if a person wants a specific outcome. The Categorical Imperative has three main formulations: acting only on maxims that could become universal laws, treating others always as ends and never merely as means, and acting as if helping to create moral laws for a society where everyone is treated as equals. To evaluate a rule, one checks for contradictions that would make it impossible or irrational if followed universally. These contradictions reveal either perfect duties, such as not lying, or imperfect duties, like helping others. The principle is based on reason, not consequences or feelings, and assumes that moral actions come from autonomy—choosing to follow moral laws through rational thought. It also emphasizes the inherent worth of all individuals, who must be respected as rational beings capable of moral decision-making.
