**Defence mechanisms** are like secret tricks your brain uses to help you feel better when something is too upsetting, scary, or confusing to deal with directly. They happen without you knowing—it’s your unconscious mind’s way of protecting you.

For example, if something bad happens and it’s too hard to accept, your brain might use **denial**, which means acting like it didn’t happen. Or if you feel angry at someone but don’t want to admit it, you might use **displacement** and take it out on someone else, like snapping at your friend instead.

These tricks come from a part of your mind called the **ego**, which tries to keep peace between your wild feelings (**id**) and your sense of right and wrong (**superego**).

Some defence mechanisms are more helpful, like **humor** or **sublimation**, where you turn your feelings into something creative or useful. Others, like **projection** or **splitting**, can cause problems if you use them too much.

Everyone uses defence mechanisms—they’re normal! But learning about them can help you notice when your mind is trying to protect you in ways that might not really help in the long run.
