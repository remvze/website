**Erich Fromm** identified **five key human needs** that shape how people experience life and maintain psychological health.

The need for **relatedness** means people thrive on meaningful connections, balancing intimacy with independence and viewing genuine love as an active, committed effort to support another’s growth.

**Transcendence** refers to the human urge to create and shape the world, which is satisfied through productive work and artistic or personal expression; when this drive is blocked, it can turn into destructiveness.

**Rootedness** is about belonging—since human self-awareness separates us from nature, people look for belonging in families, communities, and traditions, but healthy belonging allows for both connection and personal growth, while unhealthy forms become rigid or exclusionary.

The **sense of identity** involves the process of individuation, where people form a clear answer to “Who am I?” by recognizing their unique values and abilities, rather than simply conforming or becoming self-obsessed.

Lastly, **frame of orientation** describes the need for a meaningful worldview or set of beliefs that help people interpret their experiences and guide their actions, with healthy frameworks balancing reason and feeling, while unhealthy ones become overly rigid or meaningless.
