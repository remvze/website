**Fitch’s paradox of knowability** explores a puzzle in **epistemic logic**—a branch of logic concerned with knowledge—by showing a surprising consequence of the **“knowability thesis,”** which claims that every truth can, in principle, be known.

The paradox points out that if all truths are knowable, then it actually follows that every truth is **already** known, a much stronger claim called the **“omniscience principle.”**

The reasoning is that if there’s a truth that nobody knows—an _**“unknown truth”**_—then, assuming knowability, it should be possible to know that _**“this truth is unknown.”**_ But as soon as it becomes known that a truth is unknown, it can no longer be unknown, creating a contradiction. Therefore, under the knowability thesis, **unknown truths cannot exist**, so every truth must be known.

This challenges the views of **verificationists** and **anti-realists**, who believe truth is closely tied to what can be **verified** or **known**, since they find the **idea of omniscience implausible**.

The logic behind the paradox minimally assumes **standard principles** about **knowledge** (“if something is known, it’s true,” and “if each part of something is known, the whole is known”) and **possibility** (“every truth is possibly knowable”), but these generate the contradiction.

The paradox can be generalized to other concepts like **belief** or **causation**, showing its broader impact on how we think about **knowledge** and **possibility**.
