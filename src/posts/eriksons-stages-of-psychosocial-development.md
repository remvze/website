**Erikson’s stages of psychosocial development** describe how people go through nine key phases from infancy to old age, with each phase centered on a specific **“psychosocial crisis”**—a kind of challenge between two opposing needs or feelings that people must navigate in order to grow healthily.

In **the first stage (infancy, 0–1 year)**, babies face the challenge of **trust vs. mistrust**, depending on whether caregivers consistently meet their basic needs for things like food, comfort, and attention. Successfully resolving this crisis—by receiving reliable care—leads to the **virtue of hope**, a fundamental belief that the world is a safe and predictable place.

In **stage two (toddlerhood, 1½–2 years)**, children deal with **autonomy vs. shame and doubt** as they learn to do things on their own, like dressing themselves or choosing their toys. Encouragement during this phase helps them develop a **sense of will**, a feeling of personal control and independence.

**Stage three (early childhood, 3–4 years)** is about **initiative vs. guilt**, where kids want to make choices and take action, like inventing games or starting new projects. When encouraged to explore their interests, they build a **sense of purpose**, feeling confident in their ability to lead and make decisions.

In **stage four (middle childhood, 5–11 years)**, the focus is on **industry vs. inferiority**, as children work to master skills and feel competent, whether it’s in school subjects, sports, or hobbies. Feeling capable and productive in these areas helps them develop the **virtue of competence**.

**Stage five (adolescence, 12–17 years)** centers on **identity vs. role confusion**, where teens try out different social roles, beliefs, and behaviors to figure out who they are. Successfully navigating this period means forming a **lasting sense of self**—a virtue called **fidelity**—by committing to their own values and goals.

**Stage six (early adulthood, 18–39 years)** features **intimacy vs. isolation**. Here, people either form close, meaningful relationships with others, creating the **virtue of love**, or they fail to do so and remain socially **isolated and lonely**.

In **stage seven (middle adulthood, 40–64 years)**, the task is **generativity vs. stagnation**. This involves contributing to the next generation, perhaps through parenting, mentoring, or creating something of lasting value, which fosters the **virtue of care**. Failing to find a way to contribute can lead to a **feeling of being stuck** or **unproductive**.

**Stage eight (late adulthood, 65+ years)** is about **ego integrity vs. despair**. People reflect on their life and feel either a **sense of satisfaction** and **fulfillment**—gaining the **virtue of wisdom**—or they look back with regret and fall into despair over missed opportunities.

Finally, the **ninth stage**—introduced by **Joan Erikson** for people in their **eighties and nineties**—suggests that earlier life crises **return in a new form**. As elders face increased dependency and physical limitations, they revisit their sense of self, doubts about their autonomy, and feelings of worth, and ultimately must find hope and trust again despite their growing limitations.

At every stage, how well someone manages the crisis shapes their **outlook**, **relationships**, and **ability to face future challenges**, showing the lifelong connection between inner needs and social experiences.
