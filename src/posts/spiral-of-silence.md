**Spiral of silence** theory says people speak up or go quiet based on their perception of public opinion—the **climate of opinion**—not just their own beliefs.

It starts with **fear of isolation** (being socially left out) and relies on a **quasi-statistical sense** (an informal mental tally) that estimates whether one’s view is the majority or minority on a divisive issue of public interest. If a view seems popular or gaining ground, people voice it; if it seems unpopular or losing ground, they self-censor.

This imbalance in who talks creates a **positive feedback loop**: the active side is heard more, appears larger than it is, gets more exposure, and solidifies into a **social norm** (a shared _“right way”_ to speak or act), while the quieter side seems smaller and retreats further.

The process works at the **micro level** (individual willingness to express) and the **macro level** (shifts in the overall opinion climate), with public opinion acting as **social control**—things you can say without risking social sanctions.

**Mass media** amplify this via **agenda-setting** (highlighting issues) and by portraying a **dominant** view that can become the status quo; predictions about _“where opinion is headed”_ can become self-fulfilling.

Some **resist**—hardcore nonconformists or a vocal minority who don’t fear isolation—so change can still start from the margins. Perceptions can be wrong (**pluralistic ignorance**), so a view many privately reject can look like the norm.

Online, the same dynamics appear: social feedback can prompt **self-censorship**, vocal minorities may still speak, and even artificial boosts can inflate apparent support and nudge the spiral.
