The "banality of evil," a concept developed by Hannah Arendt, describes the idea that terrible evil can be committed by seemingly ordinary people who lack critical thought and moral awareness, rather than by individuals driven by intense hatred or malice. These individuals often focus on performing their jobs and following orders within a system, without deeply considering the broader consequences of their actions.

A key aspect of this concept is thoughtlessness, where individuals fail to reflect on the moral implications of what they are doing. They might accept the justifications provided by the system without question or separate their professional duties from their personal ethics. The evil arises within a systemic context, where individual, routine actions contribute to large-scale harm orchestrated by the overall structure.

The motivations of those who participate in this "banal" evil tend to be superficial, driven by factors such as career ambition, social acceptance within the system, or fear of not obeying orders, rather than a deep commitment to evil ideologies. This raises questions about moral responsibility and obedience, suggesting that simply "following orders" does not excuse individuals from accountability for their actions, as the capacity for moral judgment is a fundamental human attribute.

The concept is particularly relevant to understanding totalitarianism, where the participation of many ordinary, unthinking individuals is essential for the regime's atrocities. It challenges the traditional view of evil as stemming from profound wickedness, indicating that it can also arise from a widespread lack of critical engagement and moral imagination.
