The "banality of evil" is the idea that people can do very harmful things not out of deep hatred or cruelty, but because they follow orders, follow rules, or stop thinking about right and wrong. It means that ordinary people, by not questioning their actions or the system they’re part of, can become part of serious wrongdoing without seeing themselves as bad or realizing the full impact of what they’re doing.
