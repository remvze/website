The "banality of evil" is a concept introduced by political thinker Hannah Arendt to describe how ordinary people can commit harmful acts without malicious intent, simply by following orders or conforming to rules. It suggests that great wrongdoing can stem from thoughtlessness rather than cruelty, as individuals carry out tasks without reflecting on their moral consequences. In bureaucratic systems, responsibility is often divided and distanced from the outcomes, allowing people to contribute to harm while feeling detached from it. Arendt observed that such individuals may appear normal and efficient, yet fail to question the ethics of their actions. This idea highlights how legal or official systems can enable wrongdoing when individuals stop thinking critically and defer entirely to authority. Under totalitarian regimes, this process is intensified as personal judgment is replaced by loyalty to the system. The concept challenges the belief that evil is always driven by intent, showing instead how it can become routine and systematized. It emphasizes the importance of moral awareness and individual responsibility, especially within structures that discourage independent thought.
