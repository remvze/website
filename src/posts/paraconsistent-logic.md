Paraconsistent logic is a type of reasoning that differs from standard logic by allowing for contradictions without making everything meaningless.

In regular logic, if something is both true and false, then any statement can be proven true. Paraconsistent logic avoids this "explosion" by weakening the rules of implication or restricting how we combine statements. This means that even if there's conflicting information, we can still draw sensible conclusions that don't automatically make everything true.

There are various approaches to paraconsistent logic, including those that focus on relevance between statements, limit the formation of contradictions, or use more than just "true" and "false" values.

These logics are useful in situations where dealing with inconsistent information is necessary, such as in artificial intelligence or when managing conflicting data.
