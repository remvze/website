Paraconsistent logic is a type of logic that allows contradictions to exist without causing the whole system to break down. Unlike traditional logic, where one contradiction can make everything unreliable, paraconsistent logic prevents this by changing how conclusions are drawn. This lets people reason through problems even when some information is unclear or conflicting, without assuming everything must be either completely true or completely false.
