The **demarcation problem** asks how to tell **science** from **non-science**, including **pseudoscience**, and why that boundary matters.

Early thinkers like **Aristotle** tied **“scientific”** knowledge to **causes**, **logical demonstration**, **universals**, and **apodictic certainty**, though some ancient “natural” explanations leaned little on observation.

Later, **logical positivism** proposed **verificationism**: a claim is meaningful and **“scientific”** if it is verifiable in the observable world or from derived experience; claims beyond that were classed as **metaphysics**.

**Karl Popper** rejected **verifiability** and offered **falsifiability** instead: a claim counts as scientific if it could in principle clash with possible observations; he treated this as **necessary** and **sufficient**, though critics noted it can exclude some real science and admit some pseudosciences.

**Thomas Kuhn** shifted focus to normal science as **puzzle-solving** within a **paradigm** (a shared problem-solving framework) and contrasted it with fields like astrology that, he argued, generate no research puzzles; Popper objected that this makes demarcation **sociological**.

**Paul Feyerabend** and **Imre Lakatos** questioned whether science has any special method at all.

**Paul Thagard** called a theory unscientific when it lags behind alternatives, has many unsolved problems, and its community avoids fair tests and selectively handles evidence; by this view, **pseudoscience** is **stagnation** without active investigation.

**Larry Laudan** concluded no single demarcation rule works and urged asking instead which beliefs are reliable or unreliable. Afterward, some suggested multiple criteria or _**“family resemblances.”**_

The stakes include education, public policy, critical thinking in democracy, high-profile disputes such as climate-change denial, resisting political or religious authority over factual truth, and even comparisons to spotting fake news.
