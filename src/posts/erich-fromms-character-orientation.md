**Erich Fromm**, in his theory of **character orientation**, suggests that we relate to the world in two key ways: one is by acquiring and using things (which is called **assimilation**), and the other is by relating to ourselves and others (called **socialization**).

He believed these interactions could be either **nonproductive** or **productive**, identifying **five** main orientations that form a person's character.

Four of those are considered **nonproductive**: **the Receptive orientatio**n describes people who passively sit and wait for others to provide for them.

**The Exploitative orientation** is for those who aggressively take whatever they want from others.

**The Hoarding orientation** applies to those people who save everything they've got, from possessions to feelings.

And the last nonproductive orientation, **the Marketing orientation**, is for people who see themselves as a product to be sold. These people's value is based on their ability to **market** themselves.

The fifth and final orientation is the only **productive orientation** that represents a healthy personality. People with this orientation embrace **freedom** and **responsibility**: they don't hide behind a _**"mask."**_

While an individual's character is a **blend** of these orientations, one is typically more **dominant** than the others.
