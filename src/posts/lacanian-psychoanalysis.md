Lacanian psychoanalysis is a way of understanding the mind that focuses on how language shapes who we are and what we want. It sees people as divided between what they know and what they don’t know about themselves. Our desires are influenced by others and are built around a sense of something missing. This approach looks closely at speech, dreams, and behavior to uncover hidden thoughts and help people face their true desires.
