**Hanlon's razor** is a simple yet useful rule of thumb: don't assume **bad intentions** when someone's actions can just as easily be explained by a **lack of understanding** or **carelessness**.

In other words: _**"Never attribute to malice that which is adequately explained by stupidity."**_

As a **philosophical razor** (a tool for quickly ruling out less likely explanations) it helps us avoid unnecessary suspicion by favoring simpler, non-malicious reasons for mistakes or problems, since that is often the more likely cause of trouble.
