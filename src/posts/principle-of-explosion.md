The Principle of Explosion is a rule in classical logic stating that if a contradiction is accepted as true, then any statement can be proven from it. A contradiction occurs when two opposite claims, such as a statement and its denial, are both held to be true at the same time. In formal terms, from the falsehood symbolized by `⊥`, any proposition `ϕ` can be derived, written as `⊥⊢ϕ`. This happens because classical logic allows rules like disjunction introduction and disjunctive syllogism, which enable deriving any conclusion once a contradiction is present. The presence of contradictions in a logical system makes it inconsistent and causes the system to become trivial, meaning every statement becomes provable. To avoid this, consistent logical systems do not allow contradictions to hold. Some alternative logics, called paraconsistent logics, reject the Principle of Explosion to manage contradictions without collapsing into triviality. These systems are useful when dealing with real-world situations where contradictory information may appear but should not imply that all statements are true.
