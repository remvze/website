The Principle of Explosion states that within a logical system, if a statement and its opposite are both true, then any statement whatsoever can be proven true. A contradiction acts like a logical breaking point, eliminating the distinction between truth and falsehood. Once a contradiction exists, the system becomes trivial, as it allows for the derivation of any conclusion, regardless of its actual validity.
