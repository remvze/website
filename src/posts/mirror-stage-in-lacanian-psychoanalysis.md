The Mirror Stage is a moment in early childhood when a baby first recognizes their reflection as themselves. This creates a sense of being a whole, separate person, even though the childâ€™s actual experience of their body is still uncoordinated. The image in the mirror becomes the first version of the self, shaping how the child sees themselves. This self-image is based on an illusion and forms the foundation for how identity develops.
