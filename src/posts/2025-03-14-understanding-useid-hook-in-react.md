The `useId` hook in React generates unique, stable IDs that remain consistent across both server-side and client-side rendering.

This hook is primarily intended for accessibility purposes, helping ensure that elements such as form inputs and labels have unique identifiers.

It also helps avoid ID collisions, making it especially useful when building reusable components that require unique IDs for multiple instances.

## Example

```javascript
import React, { useId } from 'react';

function LabeledInput({ label }) {
  const inputId = useId();

  return (
    <div>
      <label htmlFor={inputId}>{label}</label>
      <input type="text" id={inputId} />
    </div>
  );
}

function MyForm() {
  return (
    <div>
      <LabeledInput label="First Name" />
      <LabeledInput label="Last Name" />
      <LabeledInput label="Email" />
    </div>
  );
}

export default MyForm;
```

In this example:

- `useId()` generates a unique ID for each `LabeledInput` component.
- The generated `inputId` is used to connect the `<label>` and `<input>` elements via the `htmlFor` and `id` attributes, respectively.
- This ensures that each input has a unique ID, even when the `LabeledInput` component is used multiple times within the `MyForm`. This is crucial for accessibility, so screen readers can correctly associate the labels with their inputs.

**Note**: If a static id was used, instead of a unique ID generated by `useId` hook, such as `"myInput"`, there would be id collisions.
