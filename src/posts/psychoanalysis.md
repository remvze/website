**Psychoanalysis** is a field that explores how hidden, or **unconscious**, parts of our minds influence our **conscious** thoughts, feelings, and behaviors.

Founded in the 1890s by **Sigmund Freud**, it proposes that much of our mental life operates outside of awareness, shaped by early **childhood experiences** and **internal conflicts**.

The central model divides the **psyche** into three parts: the **id** (primitive drives and instincts), the **ego** (the rational, reality-oriented part), and the **superego** (internalized societal rules and morals).

These parts often come into conflict, especially when the ego tries to manage the demands of both the id and the superego.

**Psychoanalysis** sees mental problems as resulting from **unresolved past traumas**, which the mind tries to keep **unconscious** through d**efense mechanisms** like **repression**—a kind of mental **“blocking.”**

To help people, psychoanalytic therapy uses talk techniques like **free association** (saying whatever comes to mind) and **dream interpretation**, aiming to bring hidden thoughts and feelings to light so the ego can manage them more realistically.

Influential ideas include the **Oedipus complex** (a child's unconscious feelings toward parents), the **importance of sexuality**, and the idea that our psychic energy, or **libido**, comes in both **life-affirming (Eros)** and **destructive (death drive)** forms.

Though debated as a therapy, psychoanalysis remains important in psychology and culture, shaping how we think about minds, development, symbols in dreams, and the link between early experiences and adult life.
