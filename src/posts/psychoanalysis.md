Psychoanalysis is a way of understanding how our hidden, unconscious thoughts and feelings influence our conscious thoughts, emotions, and behaviors. It suggests that unresolved conflicts and desires in this unconscious part of our mind can lead to difficulties. Through exploration, often in therapy, the goal is to bring these unconscious elements into awareness to gain self-understanding and work through problems.
