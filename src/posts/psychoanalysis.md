Psychoanalysis is a method of understanding the mind and treating emotional problems by exploring thoughts and feelings that are often hidden from awareness. It is based on the idea that unconscious thoughts and memories, especially those from early childhood, influence behavior, emotions, and relationships. The mind is seen as having three parts: the id, which seeks pleasure; the superego, which represents moral rules; and the ego, which tries to balance the two with reality. When inner conflicts arise, the mind uses defense mechanisms like repression or denial to reduce anxiety. These hidden conflicts can lead to symptoms such as anxiety, depression, or physical issues without a clear cause. Psychoanalytic therapy aims to uncover unconscious material through techniques like free association, dream analysis, and exploring patterns in relationships. A key part of therapy is transference, where the person projects past feelings onto the therapist. Different schools of psychoanalysis focus on various aspects, such as inner relationships with others, the development of the self, or the emotional exchange between therapist and patient. The overall goal is to increase self-awareness and reduce emotional suffering by understanding the deeper sources of psychological difficulties.
