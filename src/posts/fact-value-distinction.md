The **fact–value distinction** is a way of telling the difference between two kinds of statements: **facts** and **values**. A fact is something that describes what _is_—like saying, “The sky is blue” or “Water freezes at 0 degrees Celsius.” These are called **descriptive statements** because they describe the world, and we can usually check if they’re true.

A **value**, on the other hand, is about what we think is **good**, **bad**, or what **should** happen—like saying, “People should be kind” or “It’s wrong to steal.” These are called **normative statements**, and they show beliefs or feelings about right and wrong.

The fact–value distinction helps us see that just because something is a certain way doesn’t mean it ought to be that way. This idea is known as the **is–ought gap**.

Some words, like “cruel” or “brave,” are tricky because they mix facts and values—they describe something and also judge it—and these are called **thick concepts**.

People who study ethics use this distinction to figure out where our opinions come from and whether they’re based on evidence or just personal values. It’s a helpful way to keep our thinking clear when we talk about the world and what we believe about it.
