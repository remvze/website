The Id, Ego, and Superego are three parts of the mind that work together to shape thoughts and behavior. The Id wants immediate pleasure and avoids pain, the Superego follows rules and aims for moral perfection, and the Ego tries to balance both while dealing with real-life situations. The Ego makes choices by managing the demands of the Id, the Superego, and the outside world to help a person act in a reasonable and socially acceptable way.
