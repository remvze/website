Your mind is kind of like a team with three parts that all have different jobs: the Id, the Ego, and the Superego.

The Id is like a little kid inside you that wants things right now—like candy, fun, or to stay up late. It doesn’t care about rules or what’s possible; it just wants to feel good.

The Superego is like your inner teacher or parent. It tells you what’s right and wrong, and it wants you to be good and make proud choices.

Then there’s the Ego, which is like the team leader trying to keep everyone happy. The Ego listens to the Id and the Superego and tries to make smart choices in the real world—kind of like a referee. It uses something called the reality principle, which means it helps you get what you want without getting in trouble or feeling guilty.

Sometimes these three parts argue, and that can make you feel stressed or confused. But they all work together to help you make decisions, stay safe, and feel okay about who you are.

Understanding them helps us see why we sometimes feel pulled in different directions inside our own heads.
