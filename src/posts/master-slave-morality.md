Introduced by the philosopher **Friedrich Nietzsche**, **master–slave morality** describes two very different ways people decide what is right and wrong.

**Master morality** is the mindset of the powerful: those who see themselves as noble, strong, and life-affirming.

For these individuals (**"masters"**), **"good"** means whatever reflects their strength, confidence, and pursuit of excellence, while **"bad"** simply describes what is ordinary, weak, or the opposite of their own values—it does not mean **evil**.

They create values based on what helps them thrive, guided by traits like **courage**, **honesty**, and **self-assertion**, all of which serve their _**“will to power,”**_ or drive to realize their potential.

**Slave morality**, in contrast, forms as a reaction against the **masters** by those without power (**"slaves"**). Because the weak are envious or resentful (a feeling Nietzsche labels **ressentiment**), they invert the **master's values**.

The very traits the powerful admire become **"evil,"** while humility, kindness, and pity become **"good."**

**Slave morality** values what is useful for **everyone** rather than just the strong, emphasizing **equality** and **compassion**.

Over time, **Nietzsche** argues, **slave morality** became dominant in Western culture, especially through **Christianity** and democratic movements, which promote ideas of universal human worth and freedom.

In this way, every society's view of right and wrong reflects a struggle between these two moral outlooks and the groups that support them.
