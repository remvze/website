**Transcendental idealism** is a philosophical system developed by **Immanuel Kant** to explain how we experience and understand the world. According to **Kant**, we do learn about things through our senses, such as sight and touch, but more is happening beneath the surface.

In this view, **space and time** are not features of the external world existing independently. Instead, they are _**forms of intuition**_—built-in frameworks our minds use to organize what we perceive.

These forms are **a priori**, meaning they are present in the mind before any particular experience, and they serve as the necessary conditions that make all experience possible.

What we encounter in daily life, which Kant calls **phenomena**, are not things as they are in themselves (the **noumena**), but things as they appear to us through the lens of our mental structures.

This approach is called **transcendental** because it goes beyond simply reporting what our senses tell us. Its goal is to uncover the mind’s essential role in making knowledge possible in the first place.

From this standpoint, Kant argued that we can have genuine scientific knowledge about **appearances** as they are shaped by our minds, but not about the **ultimate reality** that exists beyond them.

This bold claim sparked long-running debates. Critics, such as defenders of **naïve realism**, insisted that we perceive the world exactly as it is, independent of our minds. Others built on Kant’s insights, offering new interpretations and adaptations that continue to shape philosophy today.
