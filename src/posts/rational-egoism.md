Rational egoism is the ethical view that individuals ought to act in ways that promote their own self-interest, and that doing so is the most reasonable or logical choice. It is a normative theory, meaning it prescribes how people should behave rather than describing how they do behave. The theory holds that rational actions are those that effectively achieve a person's goals, with self-interest—such as happiness, well-being, or personal fulfillment—being the ultimate goal. It relies on instrumental rationality, where decisions are judged by how well they serve an individual’s aims. Rational egoism is distinct from psychological egoism, which claims people always act in their own interest; instead, it argues that they should. It stands in contrast to altruism, which prioritizes the interests of others. The theory also supports moral individualism, emphasizing that the individual’s good is paramount. It may include long-term planning and cooperation if these serve one’s own benefit. Rational egoism is also linked to decision theory and game theory, where rational agents seek to maximize personal outcomes. While it promotes consistency in pursuing self-interest, it faces criticism for potential conflicts between individuals’ goals and for excluding duties to others.
