Rational Egoism is a theory that says people should always act in ways that best serve their own self-interest, using reason to determine what benefits them most. It views acting in one’s own long-term well-being as the most rational choice, rather than simply seeking immediate pleasure. This approach to decision-making emphasizes careful thinking about personal goals and values to promote individual flourishing. Unlike ethical views that prioritize others’ interests, Rational Egoism holds that it is both rational and morally right to focus on oneself. The theory distinguishes between choosing the best means to achieve goals and choosing the goals themselves, claiming that rationality requires valuing one’s own good. It is a normative theory, explaining how people ought to act, rather than describing how they actually behave. Rational Egoism often considers future consequences and opposes self-destructive or impulsive actions. It also raises questions about conflicts between self-interest and duties to others, as well as how rationality relates to morality. The theory can be analyzed using decision-making frameworks where individuals aim to maximize their expected benefit.
