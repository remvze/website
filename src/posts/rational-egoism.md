Rational Egoism is the idea that it is logical and reasonable for a person to act in their own self-interest, meaning they should make choices that benefit themselves based on careful thinking. It suggests that looking out for one’s own well-being is the best way to make decisions, as each person knows what is best for their own life and happiness. Unlike ideas that focus on helping others as a main goal, Rational Egoism says your own interests come first, but this does not mean being selfish in a harmful way—acting in your self-interest includes thinking about the long-term effects and avoiding actions that might hurt you later, such as damaging relationships. This approach emphasizes that your personal welfare is the ultimate aim of your actions, and it relies on reasoning to choose the best means to achieve this goal. Rational Egoism differs from other ethical views that prioritize the greater good or moral duties, and it can be connected to ideas in decision-making where people try to maximize their own benefits. It is a guide for how people should act rather than just describing what they do.
