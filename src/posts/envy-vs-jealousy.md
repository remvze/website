**Envy** and **jealousy** are often mixed up in everyday talk, but philosophers see them as different emotions with unique focuses.

**Jealousy** usually involves three elements: a person (the **subject**), someone they care about (the **beloved**), and a **rival** who threatens to take away the beloved’s attention or affection. Here, the main worry is about **losing the beloved**, not about the rival. So, if someone is jealous, they are most concerned with keeping their unique bond with the beloved intact, and the rival could be just about anyone—it’s the possible loss of this special relationship that matters.

**Envy**, on the other hand, is more about a **two-player scenario**: the **subject** and the **rival**, with a particular _**“good”**_ (which could be anything desirable, even someone’s affection) possessed by the rival. The envious person’s key concern is what the rival has, not the loss of a relationship. If their rival got the **“good”** from someone else, they’d still feel bothered, showing that competition with the rival is central.

So, **jealousy** is centered around keeping a valued relationship, while **envy** is about resenting someone else’s possession of something desired.
