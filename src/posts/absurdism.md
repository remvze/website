Absurdism is a big idea that starts with a simple problem: people really want life to have a clear meaning or purpose, but the world doesn’t give one. We ask questions like “Why are we here?” or “What’s the point of life?”, but the universe stays quiet. That clash between our need for answers and the silence we get back is called the absurd.

Absurdism doesn’t mean everything is bad or pointless—it just says we don’t get built-in instructions for how to live. Some people try to escape that feeling by pretending life has a clear meaning, or they give up completely.

But Absurdism says there’s a better way: face the absurd, accept it, and keep living anyway. That’s called revolt—not fighting with fists, but living with awareness and courage.

When you accept that life doesn’t come with a meaning and still choose to live fully, you gain something called absurd freedom. It means you’re free to make your own choices and find joy, even without perfect answers.

So, Absurdism is about being honest with yourself, not pretending, and still living with purpose—even when life feels strange or mysterious.
