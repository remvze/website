Absurdism is the idea that people naturally seek meaning in life, but the universe offers no clear answers or purpose. This creates a conflict known as the absurd. Instead of giving up or turning to comforting beliefs, Absurdism encourages accepting this lack of meaning and continuing to live fully. It suggests we can find value through awareness, action, and experience—even when life itself has no built-in reason or explanation.
