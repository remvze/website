Absurdism is a philosophical view centered on the conflict between the human desire to find meaning in life and the apparent lack of inherent meaning in the universe. This conflict creates what is called the absurdâ€”the tension that arises when people search for purpose in a world that offers no clear answers.

Rather than falling into despair or nihilism, Absurdism encourages individuals to recognize this condition and continue living fully despite it. The absurd hero is someone who accepts the lack of ultimate meaning but chooses to live with awareness, freedom, and defiance.

Unlike existentialism, which emphasizes creating personal meaning, or nihilism, which concludes that nothing matters, Absurdism focuses on accepting uncertainty without relying on false beliefs. This acceptance brings freedom, allowing people to choose their own values and experiences.

Emotion plays a key role, as Absurdism involves not only recognizing meaninglessness but also responding with humor, resilience, or passion. The philosophy encourages embracing the unpredictability of life and finding value in personal moments, even without a grand purpose.

Rather than offering a solution to the absurd, it promotes honest engagement with life as it is, without seeking final answers.
