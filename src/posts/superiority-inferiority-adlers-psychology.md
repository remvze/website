In Adler’s psychology, everyone starts out with **feelings of inferiority**, which just means we all feel small, weak, or not-good-enough sometimes—especially as kids. That’s normal! These feelings actually help us grow because they push us to get better at things.

Wanting to improve is called **striving for superiority**—but don’t worry, it’s not about being better than others. It means trying to become the best version of yourself. If you handle inferiority in a healthy way, you grow stronger and more confident.

But sometimes, people feel **too inferior**, and that can turn into an **inferiority complex**, where they believe they’ll never be good enough. Other times, people try to hide those feelings by acting like they’re super important or better than everyone—that’s called a **superiority complex**.

What really helps us grow in a healthy way is something called **social interest**, which means caring about and helping others while we try to improve ourselves. So, in Adler’s view, everyone feels “less than” sometimes, but those feelings are like fuel—if we use them right, they help us grow, feel capable, and make the world a better place.
