Dialetheism is the view that some statements can be both true and false at the same time. This challenges the usual idea that something must be either true or false, but not both. Dialetheists believe that certain kinds of contradictions, like logical or language paradoxes, are real and should be accepted rather than avoided. They use special types of logic to handle these cases without letting everything become confused or meaningless.
