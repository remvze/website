**Conway's Law** says that the way a team or company communicates shapes the design of the systems or products they build. If people work in separate groups and don't talk much across teams, the final product will likely end up with parts that match those divisions, even if that's not ideal.

This happens because team members must coordinate with each other to make things fit together, and it's easier to do that within existing communication paths. The idea shows up most in software design but applies to many technical fields, where the layout of a product often mirrors the structure of the group that made it.
