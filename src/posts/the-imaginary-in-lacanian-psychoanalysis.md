The Imaginary in Lacanian psychoanalysis is the realm of images and identifications that forms our sense of self, or ego. It begins with recognizing our whole reflection in a mirror, creating an idealized image we identify with. This leads to a feeling of unity and mastery, though it's based on an external image and involves a degree of misrecognition of our true, fragmented being. Relationships in this realm are often dualistic and based on these identifications.
