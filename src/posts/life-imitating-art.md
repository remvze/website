The idea of _**"life imitating art"**_ is a philosophical viewpoint suggesting that real-life actions, events, and even perceptions can be shaped by works of fiction and art, rather than the other way around.

Known as **anti-mimesis**, this concept stands in contrast to **mimesis**, the classical idea that art simply copies real life.

A prominent thinker, **Oscar Wilde**, argued that people notice and experience things—such as the beauty of London fog—because art has taught them to see those qualities, not because the qualities existed independently.

In this view, art doesn't merely reflect reality; it provides people with new ways to express themselves and interpret the world, offering _**"beautiful forms"**_ through which life realizes its own energy.

Other writers, such as **George Bernard Shaw**, observed that features admired in art later become common in real people, suggesting that fiction can shape reality.

However, **Shaw** also criticized the process when people attempted to copy **unrealistic** or **overly romanticized** art.

The debate around life imitating art is tied to broader philosophical discussions between **Romanticism** (emphasizing imagination and emotion) and **Realism** (focusing on accurate depiction of life), with roots traceable to older traditions in literature and thought.
