**Pseudoscience** and **pseudophilosophy** are best understood as types of **“Bullshit”**—a technical concept where a speaker isn’t interested in whether what they say is true or false, but simply doesn’t care about truth at all.

Unlike a **liar**, who knows the truth and tries to hide it, or an **honest** person, who tries to speak what they believe is true, a **“bullshitter”** operates without regard for accuracy or reality.

Philosopher **Victor Moberger**’s analysis highlights that the real problem in **pseudoscience** (such as astrology or creationism, which mimic science) and **pseudophilosophy** (which takes on philosophical airs in misleading ways) is not just incorrect claims, but bad intellectual habits—what he calls **“epistemic malpractice.”**

This refers to a failure of **"epistemic conscientiousness,"** meaning a willingness and ability to be guided by evidence, reasoning, and argument, but choosing not to exercise it.

The focus is shifted from tallying up which specific claims are right or wrong—a task made endless and often unproductive by the sheer number of dubious claims—to understanding the underlying **attitude** of willful disregard for truth and good reasoning.

**Moberger**’s approach also recognizes that what counts as **pseudoscience** changes over time (for example, alchemy used to be considered a science), yet the persistent issue is this activity of **BSing** itself.

Additionally, even those defending real science or philosophy can commit the same error if they dismiss unusual ideas **without thoughtful analysis**.

The heart of the issue across both **genuine** and **pseudo knowledge-seeking** is whether people genuinely care about truth and responsibly engage with evidence, making carelessness about truth the core vice behind both **pseudoscience** and **pseudophilosophy**.
