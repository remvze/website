**Individual psychology**, created by **Alfred Adler**, is a type of psychology that focuses on understanding people as unified, whole beings rather than collections of conflicting parts.

It looks at how each person's unique personality develops, emphasizing the importance of the environment they are born into, including factors like **birth order** or **early challenges**. Instead of seeing behavior as driven mainly by **unconscious sexual urges** (as Freud proposed), Adler believed humans are shaped by how they perceive the world and their need to belong within society: a concept called **social interest**, which means feeling connected and useful to others.

Central to this approach is the idea that people often feel a sense of **inferiority** (feeling less than others or inadequate), which then fuels their motivation and shapes personality: some strive to improve and overcome these feelings (**compensation** or even **overcompensation**), while others may give up (**resignation**) or withdraw into fantasy worlds.

**Adler** stressed that humans are naturally social and need strong connections with others to feel well and develop fully. Instead of just focusing on what’s wrong, this theory emphasizes **encouragement** and the **potential for change**.

In therapy, helping people recognize their own life plans, challenge unhelpful beliefs (known as **private logic**), and develop **social interest** can reduce self-defeating behaviors. Adlerian therapy often uses practical steps like **guided discussions**, **role-play**, and **positive reinforcement** to help people build a healthier, more connected life.
