**Individual Psychology** is a way of understanding people by looking at how they think, feel, and act as a whole. It says that everyone is trying to reach **goals**, even if they don’t realize it—like wanting to feel important, safe, or connected. These goals come from something called a **lifestyle**, which is your own special way of looking at the world and deciding how to deal with it.

You create your **lifestyle** when you’re young, based on how you see yourself and others. Sometimes people feel **inferior**—like they’re not good enough—and they try to **compensate** by working harder or acting confident. But if this goes too far, it can cause problems.

Individual Psychology also talks a lot about **social interest**, which means caring about others and wanting to be part of a community. People who feel like they belong usually do better in life.

A big idea is that we have a **creative self**, which means we’re not stuck—we can choose how we live and what kind of person we want to be. So instead of just asking “What happened to you?” this way of thinking asks, “What are you trying to do with your life, and how can we help you do it in a healthy way?”
