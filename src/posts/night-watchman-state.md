A Night-Watchman State is a model of government limited to protecting individual rights through police, courts, and a military, without providing public services or regulating the economy. It is based on the idea that government should prevent harm, theft, and fraud while otherwise staying out of people's lives. This type of state supports free markets, private property, and voluntary cooperation, leaving education, healthcare, and welfare to individuals or private organizations. It protects negative rights—freedom from interference—rather than offering benefits or resources. The model reflects principles of classical liberalism and libertarianism, viewing individual responsibility and limited authority as central to a just society. Laws in such a state exist only to safeguard personal freedom and enforce contracts. Critics argue that it may fail to provide essential public goods or address inequality. Others question where to draw the line between protection and interference. Some propose even more minimal approaches, suggesting that private entities could replace all state functions. Although no country fully follows this model, it remains a key concept in debates about the role of government and the limits of state power.
