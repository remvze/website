A Night-Watchman State is a minimal form of government that exists primarily to protect individuals from force, theft, and fraud, while enforcing contracts and upholding basic laws. Its core functions are limited to maintaining police, military, and courts, avoiding involvement in areas like education, healthcare, or economic regulation.

This model is rooted in classical liberal and libertarian thought, emphasizing individual freedom and personal responsibility. It operates on the belief that government should only defend negative rights—freedoms from interference—rather than provide services or redistribute wealth. Public services and social welfare are left to private individuals, markets, or voluntary groups.

Supporters argue that restricting government power reduces inefficiency and protects personal liberty, while critics contend it may lead to inequality and insufficient support for those in need.

The Night-Watchman State is a key example of minarchism, which holds that a state’s legitimacy depends on its adherence to minimal, protective roles. Debates around this model often focus on its ability to remain limited over time, its response to market failures, and whether voluntary alternatives could replace state functions entirely.
