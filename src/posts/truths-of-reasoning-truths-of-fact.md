Truths of reasoning and truths of fact are two basic types of truth distinguished by how they are known and whether they could be different. Truths of reasoning, also called necessary truths, are known through logic or definitions and do not depend on experience. They are always true and cannot be false in any possible situation, such as “2 + 2 = 4” or “All bachelors are unmarried.” These truths are often found in logic, mathematics, and statements where the meaning alone makes the truth clear. In contrast, truths of fact, also called contingent truths, are based on observation and experience. They describe how the world actually is and could have been otherwise, such as “It is raining” or “The Eiffel Tower is in Paris.” These truths require investigation and are discovered through science, measurement, or sensory evidence. Truths of reasoning are independent of the physical world, while truths of fact depend entirely on it. The distinction also relates to analytic and synthetic statements: analytic truths involve concepts contained within each other, while synthetic truths add new information and are confirmed by evidence. This separation helps clarify how knowledge is formed and what makes a statement true.
