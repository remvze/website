## TL;DR:

Truths of reasoning are necessarily true based on logic or definitions and do not require observation (e.g., “2 + 2 = 4”); they are analytic, a priori, and true in all possible worlds. Truths of fact are contingently true based on how the world actually is and must be verified through experience (e.g., “The sky is blue”); they are synthetic, a posteriori, and true only in some possible worlds. Understanding this distinction helps clarify how we know things and how different kinds of statements are justified.

Truths of reasoning and truths of fact are two basic types of truth.

Truths of reasoning (also called Necessary Truths) are known through logic or definitions and do not require observation; they are necessarily true and cannot be false in any possible situation. These include statements like "All bachelors are unmarried" or "2 + 2 = 4," which are true by meaning alone. They are called analytic and are known a priori, meaning they can be understood without experience. They are also deductively valid, meaning they follow strict logical rules.

Truths of fact (also called Contingent Truths), on the other hand, depend on the way the world actually is and require experience or observation to verify. These are contingently true, meaning they could have been otherwise. Truths of fact include statements like "The sky is blue" or "Water boils at 100°C at sea level." They are called synthetic and are known a posteriori, or after experience. They rely on inductive reasoning and empirical methods.

Denying a truth of reasoning leads to contradiction, while denying a truth of fact does not. For example, denying "All bachelors are unmarried" creates a contradiction, because being unmarried is part of what it means to be a bachelor. In contrast, denying "The sky is blue" does not lead to contradiction, since the sky could be a different color under other conditions.

Truths of reasoning are true in all possible worlds, meaning they are independent of how the world happens to be, while truths of fact are only true in some worlds, meaning they depend entirely on how the world is.

While many truths clearly fall into one category or the other, some blur the line. For example, certain mathematical or moral claims may seem necessary but also depend on assumptions that are not purely logical.

This distinction helps clarify how knowledge is formed and how different kinds of statements are tested or proven.
