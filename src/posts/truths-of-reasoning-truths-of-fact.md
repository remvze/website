Truths of reasoning are statements that are always true just by thinking about them, like math or definitions, and donâ€™t need any observation to prove. Truths of fact are statements that describe the real world and can only be known by looking, hearing, or experiencing something. The first type is true no matter what; the second depends on how things actually are and could have been different.
