There are two main kinds of truths you can think about: truths of reasoning and truths of fact.

A truth of reasoning is something that’s true just because of how ideas or words fit together—like a puzzle that always clicks the same way. For example, “All squares have four sides” is a truth of reasoning because it’s true just by knowing what “square” means. These kinds of truths are also called analytic or necessary truths, because they can’t ever be false, no matter what.

On the other hand, a truth of fact depends on the real world. For example, “It’s sunny today” might be true now, but it could be different tomorrow. These are called contingent or synthetic truths, and we usually learn them by seeing, hearing, or experiencing something.

We also say truths of reasoning are known a priori (before experience), and truths of fact are known a posteriori (after experience). Knowing the difference helps us figure out whether we need to think logically or look at the world to find out if something is true.
