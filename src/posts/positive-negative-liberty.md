Liberty means being free, but people talk about it in two different ways: negative liberty and positive liberty.

Think of negative liberty as freedom _from_ being stopped—like when no one tells you what to do or where to go. If no one is blocking you from choosing your own clothes, that’s negative liberty. It’s all about not having interference from others, like the government or other people.

Now, positive liberty is a little different. It’s the freedom _to_ do things—like being able to learn, get a job you like, or speak up for yourself. Positive liberty is about having the ability or power to make real choices and take control of your life.

So, even if no one is stopping you (negative liberty), you might not feel truly free if you don’t have what you need—like knowledge, confidence, or support (positive liberty).

These two types of liberty are both important, but they can sometimes pull in different directions. Understanding them helps us think about what freedom really means—not just being left alone, but also having the tools to live the life you want.
