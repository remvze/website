Negative liberty is the freedom from external obstacles or interference by others, meaning one is not being prevented from doing something. Positive liberty, on the other hand, is the freedom to act and achieve one's goals, implying the presence of necessary resources and capabilities. Essentially, one is the absence of constraints, while the other is the capacity to act autonomously.
