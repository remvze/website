The **analytic–synthetic** distinction is a way to tell apart two kinds of statements, or sentences that can be true or false.

An **analytic statement** is true just because of what the words mean. For example, “All squares have four sides” is analytic, because the idea of having four sides is already part of what it means to be a square. You don’t need to go look at squares in real life—you just need to understand the words.

A **synthetic statement**, on the other hand, is true or false depending on how the world actually is. For example, “The sky is cloudy” is synthetic, because you have to look outside to check if it’s true.

Analytic statements are usually known using just **reason** or **logic**, while synthetic statements need **experience** or **observation**.

This distinction matters because it helps us understand where knowledge comes from: some things we know just by thinking carefully, and some things we know by learning about the world. Knowing the difference helps people ask better questions, make clearer arguments, and understand how language connects to reality.
