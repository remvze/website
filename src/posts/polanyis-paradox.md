**Polanyi's paradox** is the idea that humans often know how to do things without being able to explain exactly how they do them. This gap exists because much of our knowledge is _**“tacit,”**_ meaning it’s learned through **experience** and **intuition**, not by memorizing rules or facts we can easily put into words. For example, most people can recognize a familiar face or ride a bike, but struggle to spell out all the tiny steps or rules that make these actions possible.

In contrast, _**“explicit knowledge”**_ can be written down, like step-by-step instructions or facts from a textbook. Since computers and artificial intelligence (AI) rely on precise instructions or data, they struggle to replicate tasks based on tacit knowledge that humans do effortlessly, such as navigating busy roads or interpreting body language. This makes automating jobs that require **common sense**, **adaptability**, or **judgment** especially hard.

As a result, while computers have taken over many routine tasks that are easy to codify, jobs needing **abstract thinking** or **flexible manual skills** remain more resistant to automation because the necessary know-how usually isn’t something we can fully explain or program.
