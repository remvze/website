Feelings of inferiority are when someone feels “less than” or not as good as others, and they’re a big part of how people grow and learn about themselves. In Adler’s psychology, there are two types: **primary** and **secondary** feelings of inferiority.

**Primary feelings** happen when we’re young — like when kids feel small, weak, or not able to do what grown-ups or older kids can do. These feelings are normal and can actually help us try harder and get better at things, which is called **striving for superiority**.

But later on, people can get **secondary feelings of inferiority**, which show up when they feel like they’ve failed to reach their goals or dreams. These might come from trying to be perfect or always comparing themselves to others.

When these feelings become too strong, they can cause what’s called an **inferiority complex**, where someone always feels not good enough. People often try to **compensate**, or make up for these feelings, in different ways — sometimes in healthy ways, like working hard, and sometimes in unhealthy ways, like acting better than everyone else.

Understanding these ideas helps us notice where our feelings come from and how they affect the way we act and think about ourselves.
