**Perspectivism** is the idea that all **knowledge** and **perception** are shaped by the specific **viewpoint** or **perspective** of the observer, meaning there is no such thing as a completely **unbiased**, **universal**, or **“God’s-eye”** understanding of reality.

Instead, every act of knowing or interpreting is influenced by subjective factors like **context**, **personal experience**, or even **psychological biases**: no one can step entirely outside their own perspective to access absolute truth.

However, **perspectivism** does not claim that all viewpoints are **equally** valid or true; it simply holds that truth must be sought by comparing and evaluating **different perspectives**, not by referencing some reality independent of all perspectives.

This principle has been developed by philosophers such as **Nietzsche**, who argued that **objectivity** and **knowledge** are reached through examining a **diversity of perspectives**, while rejecting traditional beliefs in absolute truth or facts existing outside interpretation.

Modern variations of perspectivism also explore how scientific models, theories, and observations are limited by the standpoint of those using them.

**Perspectivism** helps explain how our understanding of the world is inevitably filtered through the frameworks and limitations of **particular perspectives**.
