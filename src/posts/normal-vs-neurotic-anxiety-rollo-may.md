Anxiety is a feeling of worry or nervousness that everyone has sometimes, like before a test or a big change. Rollo May, a psychologist, said there are two kinds: **normal anxiety** and **neurotic anxiety**.

**Normal anxiety** happens when you're facing something real, like a tough decision or new challenge. It might feel uncomfortable, but it helps you grow, learn, and make good choices — like a signal that says, _“This matters!”_

**Neurotic anxiety**, on the other hand, shows up when there’s no real danger or when the worry is way too big for the situation. It can stop you from doing things you want to do, like trying out for a team or talking to someone new.

While **normal anxiety** helps us deal with life in a healthy way, **neurotic anxiety** gets in the way and keeps us stuck. The big difference is that **normal anxiety** is helpful and makes sense, while **neurotic anxiety** is unhelpful and out of proportion.

Learning to tell the difference helps us know when to listen to our anxiety — and when to challenge it — so we can keep growing instead of getting stuck.
